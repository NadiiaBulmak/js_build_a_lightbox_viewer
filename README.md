## Description  
This project is a **lightbox gallery** that allows users to view images in a fullscreen overlay. Clicking on any image opens it in an enlarged mode with a darkened background. Users can navigate through images and close the viewer using the "âœ–" button in the top-right corner or by clicking outside the image.  

## Features  
- Open images in a **lightbox view** with a smooth transition.  
- Close the lightbox by clicking the background or the close button.  
- Responsive design for different screen sizes.  
- Smooth animations for image appearance and disappearance.  

## Technologies Used  
- **HTML** â€“ for gallery structure.  
- **CSS** â€“ for styling and animations.  
- **JavaScript** â€“ for event handling (clicks, closing, dynamic class management).  

This project showcases DOM manipulation, event listeners, and animations in web development. ðŸš€
